- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### Setup

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Start development containers**

   Make sure Docker is running, then run:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. **Access the services**
    - Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
    - Backend: [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001)
    - Neo4j Browser: [http://localhost:7474](http://localhost:7474)  
      Default login: `neo4j` / `password`
    - Mongo Express: [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)  
      Default login: `admin` / `pass`

## ðŸ“Œ Development Status

The system is under active reconstruction. Core functionality is still in progress, as the app is being re-architected
to improve modularity, scalability, and developer experience.

I am aware of plenty of security issues (such as hardcoded credentials in the Docker Compose file) and will address them
in due course. The focus is currently on building a solid foundation for the application.

Feel free to explore the code â€” this repo represents my approach to real-world fullstack systems built from the ground
up.

## Architecture

### Backend Architecture

The backend is built using **NestJS** with a modular, domain-driven design that follows clean architecture principles.
The system is designed for scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.

#### Core Architecture Patterns

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Business logic is organized around domain modules
- **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**: Separates read and write operations for better performance and
  scalability
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Uses domain events for loose coupling between modules
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data access through dedicated repository interfaces

#### Module Structure
